<p>OK, so you’ve knocked out most of your workshop.</p>

<p>All that’s left is wrap up. Here’s what need to do.</p>

<h2 id="recap">Recap</h2>

<p>It’s important to let the attendee know everything that he or she learned in the workshop. That’s pretty simple so I won’t say antyhing else about it.</p>

<h2 id="post-workshop-survey">Post Workshop Survey</h2>

<p>Collecting feedback should become an automatic part of running a workshop.  We do that by building in pre- and post- workshop surveys.</p>

<p>Post-workshop surveys should ask the following questions:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Rate the workshop from 1 to 5</li>
  <li>Would you recommend this workshop to a friend or co-worker? Why?</li>
  <li>What could have been better? What would you have liked to see more of?</li>
  <li>If you have any questions, please leave your contact info and a description here.</li>
</ul>

<p>There are a few major goals of the post-workshop survey:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Collect data on attendee’s workshop experience.</strong> This helps you improve the content and delivery of the workshop material.</li>
  <li><strong>Get follow-up information.</strong> Workshops are great because they make it easy to get invited to run workshops for specific customers, on site.  Let people know that they can request that from you, in your survey.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>NOTE:</strong> You will get a lot fewer post-survey responses than pre-survey responses. This is to be expected.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="whats-next">What’s Next?</h2>

<p>Here’s it’s time to point your workshop attendees to new information and value.  I generally point them to a landing page with additional resources about the workshop.  <a href="http://www.kubetalk.com/welcome-gophercon-2017/">Click here to see an example</a>.</p>
