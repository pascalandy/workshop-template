<p>Setting up the workshop is the hardest part. I generally run through all setup steps together to make sure everyone reaches the same starting point.</p>

<p>My goal in the setup is to get everyone to the SAME starting point. This is easiest to do if I can use a</p>

  <p><strong>Note:</strong> By workshop setup, I’m referring to any setup that the attendee has to do – during workshop time – to complete the rest of the workshop.</p>

<p>For tech workshops, I like to set variables to make the rest of the workshop easier. The goal is to make the rest of the workshop as easy as possible.</p>

<h2 id="pre-workshop-survey">Pre-Workshop Survey</h2>

<p>Collecting feedback should become an automatic part of running a workshop.  We do that by building in pre- and post- workshop surveys.</p>

<p>Pre-workshop surveys should ask the following questions:</p>
<ul>
  <li>[Hopes and Dreams] What are you hoping to get out of the workshop?</li>
  <li>[Fishing Holes] What container technologies have you used, if any?</li>
  <li>[Pains and Fears] What problems have you run into with your current solutions?</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>NOTE:</strong> To make using survey data easier, you can link a survey with a pre-filled “Event” field.  You can also add a few simple demographic questions, too.  For example, I’ll often ask about an attendee’s company size or what their job title is.</p>

<p>There are a few major goals of the pre-workshop survey:</p>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Collect data on attendee’s goals and expectations.</strong> This helps you determine if you’re positioning (the abstract, the title) are correct.</li>
  <li><strong>Tailor the workshop to attendees.</strong> After the survey look at the “Hopes and Dreams” questions and address which will be addressed in the workshop and which won’t.</li>
</ol>
